/**
	Guess The Number
	5.32-GuessTheNumber.c

	Purpose: Implement a number guessing game.

	5.32	(Guess the Number) Write a C program that plays the game of
	"guess the number" as follows: Your program chooses the number to be 
	guessed by selecting an integer at random in the range 1 to 1000.

	[Note: The searching technique employed in this problem is called
	binary search. Weï¿½ll say more about this in the next problem.]

	Changelog:

	1.2 02/12/2019 Added the ability to set the difficulty level by entering
	a range of numbers.

	1.1 02/05/2019 stat tracking to make the game more competitive and an
	initial attempt at runtime.
