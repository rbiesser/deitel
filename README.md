* You can find code examples from each chapter on the book's website

### Build with gcc

```
gcc source.c -o output.exe

or use make

make (all)
make source.exe (one source)
make clean
```
##### Each source contains an introduction and sample usage.
Some solutions are more useful than others, but this is really just an introduction to the C language.


The Math Practice Project and Menu Project are a combination of the skills learned through the intermediate exercises.
